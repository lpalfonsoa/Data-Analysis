Python was employed to validate the dataset, perform data cleansing, and make necessary adjustments to the columns, notebook available [here](https://github.com/lpalfonsoa/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Notebooks/Bike.ipynb): 

- [Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning](https://github.com/lpalfonsoa/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Notebooks/Pneumonia-Classification.ipynb):

This project focuses on evaluating and comparing the performance of three convolutional neural network (CNN) models in the classification of pneumonia from X-ray images. The primary objective was to determine the optimal model for accurate and reliable pneumonia classification. The models were trained using a dataset that incorporated data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's performance. Various evaluation metrics, including accuracy and precision, were utilized to assess the models' classification capabilities. Additionally, the code provided visualization components, such as sample image plots and TensorBoard monitoring, to aid in the analysis and interpretation of the results. The findings indicated that Model 1 exhibited the highest precision and accuracy, showcasing its effectiveness in pneumonia classification.

- [Adult income census classification](https://github.com/lpalfonsoa/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Notebooks/CensusIncome.ipynb): 

This project revolves around the analysis and prediction of income levels by leveraging demographic and socioeconomic variables. Through an extensive data cleanup process, I address missing values, handle outliers, and ensure data integrity. I employ exploratory data analysis techniques to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and understand the relationships between different features. Feature engineering is applied to enhance the predictive power of the models by creating new variables or transforming existing ones. By implementing machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, gradient boosting, and support vector machines, my aim is to classify individuals into distinct income groups accurately. The project demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering in enhancing the performance of predictive models.

- [Sales prediction models](https://github.com/lpalfonsoa/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Notebooks/Advertisement.ipynb): 

In this project, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Polynomial Regression (PR) models were utilized to predict sales based on advertising budgets across various media channels. The PR model demonstrated superior accuracy with an impressive R2-Score of 99% for both the training and testing sets. These regression models offer valuable insights into customer behavior and facilitate data-driven decision-making for optimizing marketing strategies. For future improvements, expanding the dataset size would enhance the models' performance and generalization capabilities, providing deeper insights for better decision-making and maximizing overall success.

- [Comparative analysis of science news in Colombia, Spain, and the United States (Report)](https://github.com/lpalfonsoa/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Notebooks/Comparative%20analysis%20in%20science%20news.pdf)

This article presents an analysis of the content of scientific news in selected media outlets from Colombia, Spain, and the United States. The study aims to identify patterns, differences, and similarities in the topics covered by the press in each country, using web scraping techniques and natural language processing. The data was collected from the Google News feed during a 15-day period in the first semester of 2023. The media outlets selected for each country were chosen based on their popularity and the presence of a dedicated science section. The collected news articles were processed using natural language analysis techniques. With the data, word frequency was calculated to identify the most common topics in each country, as well as the number of publications, the probability density of word frequency, and the entropy. The results showed that Colombia has the highest number of news articles, while Spain has the longest average article length. It was evident that all three countries consistently publish a steady number of articles each day. Finally, differences in entropy were found, indicating variations in the diversity of language used.

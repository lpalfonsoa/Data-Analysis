My projects:

Adult income census prediction:
This project revolves around the analysis and prediction of income levels by leveraging demographic and socioeconomic variables. Through an extensive data cleanup process, I address missing values, handle outliers, and ensure data integrity. I employ exploratory data analysis techniques to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and understand the relationships between different features. Feature engineering is applied to enhance the predictive power of the models by creating new variables or transforming existing ones. By implementing machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, gradient boosting, and support vector machines, my aim is to classify individuals into distinct income groups accurately. The project demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering in enhancing the performance of predictive models.



Cancer breast:
This breast cancer project focused on analyzing and predicting breast cancer cases by leveraging clinical and histopathological features. The study revealed that mean values of cell radius, perimeter, area, compactness, concavity, and concave points are indicative of malignant tumors. . The classification models employed in the project achieved high precision, with the k-nearest neighbors model performing the best overall. By utilizing ensemble learning with k-nearest neighbors and decision tree models, the precision of malignant tumor detection was further improved. The project's findings contribute to ongoing research in breast cancer diagnosis, highlighting the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms and paving the way for advancements in early detection and precise treatment of breast cancer.
